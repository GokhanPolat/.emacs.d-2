# .emacs.d

## Few unique things about my config

* Central place for **ALL** key bindings: setup-files/setup-key-bindings.el
* Organized init.el into little chunks

## How to use my config right away

* You will need to make few edits in **only init.el** after copying it to your local space
    - Uncomment the line(s) with tag INSTR\_UNCOMMENT\_THIS\_LINE
    - Delete the line(s) with tag INSTR\_DELETE\_THIS\_LINE
* Few setup files have setup catered my personal work area so it wouldn't make sense to completely copy those setups
    - setup-files/setup-smart-mode-line.el
    - setup-files/setup-registers.el
* If you don't like the initial frame size when emacs start, you would need to edit it in setup-files/setup-windows-buffers.el
* If you want to change the default theme, font size, etc, you would want to edit setup-files/setup-visual.el
